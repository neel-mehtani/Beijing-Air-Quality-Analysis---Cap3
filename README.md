# Beijing Air Quality Time Series Analysis

## Background and Motivation

Air pollution in urban environments has risen steadily in the last several decades. Such cities as Beijing and Delhi have
experienced rises to dangerous levels for citizens. As a growing and urgent public health concern, cities and environmental
agencies have been exploring methods to forecast future air pollution, hoping to enact policies and provide incentives and
services to benefit their citizenry. Much research is being conducted in environmental science to generate deterministic models of air pollutant behavior; however, this is both complex, as the underlying molecular interactions in the atmosphere need to be simulated, and often inaccurate. As a result, with greater computing power in the twenty-first century, using machine learning methods for forecasting air pollution has become more popular. This paper investigates the use of the LSTM recurrent neural network (RNN) as a framework for forecasting in the future, based on time series data of pollution and meteorological information in Beijing. Due to the sequence dependencies associated with large-scale and longer time series datasets, RNNs, and in particular LSTM models, are well-suited. Our results show that the LSTM framework produces equivalent accuracy when predicting future timesteps compared to the baseline support vector regression for a single timestep. Using our LSTM framework, we can now extend the prediction from a single timestep out to 5 to 10 hours into the future. This is promising in the quest for forecasting urban air quality and leveraging that insight to enact beneficial policy
